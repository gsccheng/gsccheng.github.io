To use the airport distance calculator, open `index.html` on your browser.

### Testing

This application does not have testing set up. What it would need is a test runner like Karma. I thought it would be silly to start installing Node modules just for that purpose. However, I included a sample of how a test spec for this application would look like at `test/spec/CalculateSpec.js`.

*Thank you for evaluating this application!*
