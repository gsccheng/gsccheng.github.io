		<p>My very first question on StackOverflow was on the IDE Aptana Studio 3 where I ended up not getting an answer. Looking back now, I don't even see the question in my history-- was it deleted? After asking my question, I noticed someone downvoting it without giving any explanation of why. I thought I made a very good post, and have researched extensively that the answer didn't already exist on the web. I spent a lot of time with at least what I thought was making sure my post was clear and even using Imgur to post screenshots of what I was talking about. With a lot rep, I was however limited with what I can do. Here are two great resources for asking a good question:</p><br>

		<p>One thing I have just learned however is to at least on Stack Overflow to not put the language/platform information as a header. That's what the tags are for? I did this under the mindset that it is more eyecatching and puts the reader in the right frame of mind, but it will just be redundant information with the tags.</p>
