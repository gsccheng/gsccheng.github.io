<h2>Swallowing Saliva and How I Feel that Stereotype Threats Have an Opposite Effect on Me</h2>

<div class="main_body"><p><a href=http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html>Stereotype threat</a>
	<h3>What is a Stereotype Threat?</h3>
	refers to the risk of confirming a negative stereotype about one's group. This may lead to one actually performing worse, and hence confirming the stereotype due to the anxiety of facing this threat.</p>
	
	<h3>My Experiences with Stereotype Threat</h3>
	
	<p>I cannot recall a time where I felt I have been negatively affected through a stereotype threat through a negative stereotype of a group that I identify with. However, due to the subconconcious nature of this threat, I acknowledge that it can just be because I am not aware of it.</p>
	<p>As an Asian American male of at least relatively normal (or so I hope :) ) physical features of this group, just what kinds of negative stereotypes may I possibly come across? A lot of the articles I've read regarding this threat references those that African Americans and women face, but what about my group? The stereotypes I can think of are being too shy and timid-- which helps explain poor Asian American involvement in political office-- and poor in sports that depend more on physical size and brute strength (e.g. football, basketball). I will first talk about how I feel I am actually experiencing an opposite effect of the stereotype effect. I will then go into my experience of each of the two aforementioned stereotypes, as well as commenting on what effects I feel from the positive stereotypes and how we should use them to our advantage.</p>
	<p>Contrary to the commonly described effects of stereotype threat, I feel the opposite effects. For example, I more commonly will crumble and see a decrease in performance when there are certain expectations of me. I feel it actually gives me pressure instead of giving me confidence and invigoration. My mind will lock up and I will be more focused on this aspect than the actual doing and performing. This is particularly true in public events and situations that require quick reaction, such as performances (sports, speeches, musical performances. However, I feel if people expect me to suck, that pressure is off and I have this nice room to play around in and excel. I love playing underdog. I don't believe this is normal however, as I have experienced the extremes of this. For example, I remember in middle school and high school I would have these cycles where I had performance anxiety of simple things like swallowing my saliva. Swallowing saliva isn't something that should fall under the negative stereotype category for me. In fact, it should be the opposite. I should be very normal and very good at swallowing saliva like pretty much every other human being. It is natural process. However, in thinking this, it made me conscious about when I should be swallowing my saliva. I keep asking myself, how often is it actually swallowed? Do we actually make these swallowing and gulping motions because I sure don't remember normally doing that? However, I find myself with my mouth welling up with saliva; I am forced to have to swallow it. However, when I swallow it, naturally I am forced to make very large movements with my throat and it is audible! Can someone hear that! That can't be normal right? Will it catch the attention of others? I don't see others doing it nor do I remember myself normally doing it, so it can't be normal and is only caused by this anxiety of consciously focusing on and trying to be a normal saliva swallower. Luckily I don't have this problem anymore but I think I still have lingering effects of it being manifested in other aspects of my life. The bottom line is that expectations caused by positive stereotypes can often drive me in the opposite direction.</p>
		 
	<p> As for the Asian American stereotypes, I definitely feel a lot of anxiety and feel timid and shy at times, particularly in a public setting. However, I really don't think it has anything to do with groups I identify with. In alignment with what I said in the previous paragraph, I much rather people expect this from me than someone who is outgoing and outpoken. I know specifically I easily slip into this very anxious and uncomfortable mode when this happens. For example, I will sometimes meet people who seem too comfortable around me and would make jokes, smile, laugh, in a very intense and manufactured way. I then feel that I am expected to also recipricate these same emotions at a similar intensity level. In doing so I feel this conflict in myself where I try to emulate this while inside I don't feel that. Because this is terrible and a fight/flight reaction, my fall-back/coping mechanism is to just try not to show any expression at all, which will then put me as very square, boring, and shy. If didn't feel I had to act a certain way, I would have such a reaction. I also get this a lot with speaking other languages as well or anything to do with supposedly following an identity, particularly ethnic and cultural identities.
			
	<p>I also love it when people think I suck at basketball and (I'm guilty of the same thing too) someone that is scrawnier looking would match up against me. It is so invigorating and satisfying later when I play to see the other team's surprise, frustration, and excuses when I end up doing something detrimental to their team. Meanwhile, I hate it when people say things like "watch out for that guy", that he has really good hops or is fast, as that puts the spotlight and pressure on me to meet those expectations. In those cases I feel my performance is worsened. However, I understand that there is a limit to what is deemed as negative stereotyping since a guy who is taller and more muscular is probably going to be stronger than one who is shorter and thin.</p>
	
	<p>Finally, has it been shown that positive stereotypes can improve performance? If the stereotype threat can have a negative effect from negative stereotypes, I suspect positive effects can occur from positive stereotypes for the average person.</p>
	
	<h3>How to Help Others Negatively Affected by Stereotype Threat</h3>
	
	<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/thin-ice-stereotype-threat-and-black-college-st udents/304663/">Studies</a> demonstrating the negative effects show how phrasing tests in a context of a stereotype can negatively affect someone's performance. Hence, it is important to be cognizant of negative stereotypes and not bring them up any components of it that may trigger the stereotype threat. It sounds like one safe thing in general to not bring up are topics related to intelligence or abilities in math.</p>
