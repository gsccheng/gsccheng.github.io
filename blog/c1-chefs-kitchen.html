<h2>Shereef's Fireside Chat</h2>
<p>The video reaffirmed my impression that DBC is a well-thought out program and is more of a complete learning experience. I thought the video and sound quality could be better though, but perhaps Shereef wanted to give an impression of being real and being someone like you or me.

I like and agree with the things he said. I feel more excited yet less anxious at the same time with his assurances. His explanations help paint a better picture of what to expect. For example, he addresses directly the worries people may have in terms of not being up to par with others, or being to advanced for others. He seems very reasonable in terms of really putting yourself out there and not treating DBC as something you just consume, multiple a success percentage, and see your return on investment from it.

I expect to put myself fully out there, and also form relationships and help others as well. I'm looking forward to actual coding (whereas in week1 it is just setup and reflection) and meeting others in person.

Many of the questions people have asked I have also wondered about too. For example, one of my greatest worries are that I may get hung up on a problem where I would naturally not want to let it go. This may lead to me falling behind the rest of the class. I think when the times come I would need to gauge the time and my priorities.</p>
