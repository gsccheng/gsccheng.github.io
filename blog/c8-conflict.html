		<p>A few days ago I got mugged for the first time. What makes it particularly alarming is that it happened right in front of my house, with a buddy, and in a neighborhood I thought wasn't particularly dangerous. A black male dressed in black with his face half-covered, about 5'7" quickly dashed towards us as we were entering the gateway to my house. He demanded our wallets, the items in our pockets, and threatened us with a gun. Although my gut instinct told me he didn't have one, and that the bulge in his pocket was something else, my mind went through different scenarios and in the end I figured I was supposed to do what is the "textbook" response which is to comply. So, that is what I did. While he was engaged with my friend, I threw out my keys and phone to a bush but kept my wallet. In retrospect I realized I did this so it was more believeable for me to later tell him I have nothing else in my pockets. However, I realized after talking to the police that trusting my instincts also would be a thing you should do. Hence, if this same scenario were to happen again, I would make a run for it, and I'm pretty sure I can outrun that motherf*cker. In the end, I realize not only would I run, I would also make noise, such as activating the car alarm, and throw some cash on floor as that is probably only thing the mugger is really interested in that is in my wallet. God forbid this happens again though.</p>
