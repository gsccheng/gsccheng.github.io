<h2>Unit 1 - Reflection and Moving Forward</h2>
<p> My Gregorc thinking style is a tie between Abstract Sequential and Abstract Random. With this information, below is how I am supposed to learn better and how I can accomplish this at DBC.</p>

	<tr>
		<td>Access to experts or references</td>
		<td>Have contacts and ability to set up tutoring sessions. Attend office hours as needed. Bookmarks useful reference pages in my browser.</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Placed in stimulating environments</td>
		<td>Work with people (although this may contradict the next point). Try out different learning websites for more engaging ways to learn.</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Able to work alone</td>
		<td>Make sure you have all the links and material you need so you don't need to rely on others.</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>In a personalized environment</td>
		<td>Use my own IDE. Set up my own shortcuts and program layouts.</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Given broad or general guidelines</td>
		<td>Well this is given to me so not much I can do here. Only thing I can think of is to encourage and ask instructors for more general instructions or if that is acceptable</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Able to maintain friendly relationships</td>
		<td>Be friendly, smile, be helpful, and stay positive and this shouldn't be a problem</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Able to participate in group activities</td>
		<td>Sign up and make yourself available for group activities. Sign up for any group lists to stay in the loop</td></tr></table>

<p> I don't think some of these will really apply to me for how I will learn best compared to other techniques (hence why I hate taking psychological/behavioral tests that try to categorize you). For example, I feel like and have observed many times where I feel like I've benefitted too from just diving into the file or IRB and trying to things out. Something like this is suppose to mean you're one of the concrete thinking types. Hence, I try to not look too much into any one type of learning style but just be cognizant and adaptive. I'm also not too big of a fan of timeboxing. In a way it also contradicts other articles that were provided to us about how if you're feeling the flow and "in the zone" you should keep going. So, if I feel good, focused, and in the middle of some work, I'm not going to stop just because the timer told me to. However, I feel this would be more applicable to times where you feel you are at high risk of spending a huge amount of time on something that shouldn't be spending, or on open ended problems that have a deadline.</p>

<p> Unit 1 has been a great experience so far and has met my expectations. I feel like I am getting a lot out of it so far, and feeling like I am contributing a fair amount as well.</p>
<p> Week 1 was fine and relatively smooth although I don't really enjoy the whole setup process. The whole idea and all the components that need to be set up is still not something I can do without referencing something. So, what I would like to do is create my own cheat sheet of how to get set up. This would be the one based off o DBC. I feel like I would enjoy more of the actual work instead of the setup process.</p>
<p> I found Week 2 to be challenging and very time consuming. In a way I got caught off guard. Based off of the 15 or so hours spent in week 1, and how DBC mentions that the work is about 15-20 hours a week, I only allotted that much time for the week 2 work on HTML/CSS. So, I scheduled some other things in the beginning of the week. Before I could adjust my schedule, I realized that I would run out of time and I only submitted that week's work on the Wednesday after. Part of the reason was just the sheer amount of work and the other part is the open-endedness of creating and style our blogging site and playing with the blocks. This would be contrary to what my Gregorc's learning style says. I ended up spending about triple the amount of time that is expected for that week's work, but in the end I think I got a lot out of it.</p>
<p> Week 3 went smoothly and I am starting to like Ruby more and more. I think part of the reason is that the challenges are relatively simple that may give myself an inflated confidence, but I feel relatively comfortable with it and the concepts. I particularly like how there are so many helpful methods already built into Ruby 2.0.0.</p>

<p> I realized that is it really easy to slip into the fixed mindset at DBC. It is really easy to just finish the challenges for the sake of finishing the challenges. However, I have been and am more than willing to continue to take my take and really comfortably take in all the material and exercises we are given. I am at a mindstate where I don't move on until I feel comfortable with something, and process it at a deeper level (unless it is really taking an extraordinary amount of time that will put me at risk of missing deadlines). Also, I am looking at things in the mindset of how I would deal with them in a real-world job setting. So, I am not so concerned as to how I would be perceived at DBC, but how I would retain information and how I would react in the real job world. I am also bracing myself and savoring the moment of how Phase 0 should be a lot more relaxed than the actual in-person phases. I feel great motivation to stay ahead and to at almost any cost avoid that dreaded situation where you're behind where I may be forced to crash through the material for the sake of completing it rather than learning. I think one of the keys is to give myself some buffer time room in the case I may get stuck on a certain problem, which is as much as I would like to think wouldn't happen, is bound to happen.</p>
