<h2>Classes vs. IDs - why even bother with IDs?</h2>
<p>This is actually still a question I'm trying to fully resolve.<br><br>
First, what are they? They are basically categories of selectors that are used to mark the elements of your HTML web page. 
IDs (marked as "ID") can only be used to mark one element while Classes (marked as "class") are used for multiple elements.
For example, in the HTML file a link can be described as: <br><br>

<font color=blue> &lt;a ID=one-link href=http://CNN.com>CNN...></a&gt; </font> or<br>
&lt;a class=many-links href=http://CNN.com>CNN...></a&gt; </font><br><br>

<font color=black>In the CSS file, the corresponding selectors will be the following respectively:</font><br><br>

<font color=blue>#one-link {...} </font> or<br>
.many-links {...}</font><br><br>

However, classes will work as a tag for just a single element as well. So, why even bother with IDs? Why not keep things simple? The main thing I have against it is that it will reduce flexibility if later you changed your mind and want to add addtional instances of the element.
It may also cause problems with specificity as it will trump other elements (e.g. class elements). One reason supporting the use of IDs would be for people reading the code to quickly determine that there is only one instance of a certain element.

However, is this reason enough to not stop using IDs altogether?
