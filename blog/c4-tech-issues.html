<h2>A pipeline from the ghettos to Silicon Valley</h2>
<p>Recently a lot of the big tech companies like Google and Apple have published the demographics of their workers. One of the glaring statistics is that there are very few minorities, particularly those that would come from poor socioeconomic communities that have little opportunity to break the cycle and gain high-paying jobs. How can we break this cycle and give them that opportunity? But whoa whoa whoa, step back a bit, why do we even care about them having opportunity? Even if you are a selfish and moral-less creature, you should still see that opening these opportunities for more people is beneficial to society as a whole, which includes yourself. This opens up a pool of talent that would have otherwise been muted. More talent used means the quicker society will advance technologically. The more advanced society is technologically, more than likely the quality of life is higher, including yourself!</p>

<p>In comes Yes We Code!</p>
<p/> Yes We Code is an initiative to get 100,000 low-opportunity young people trained to be the best computer coders in the world. It includes hack-a-thon events backed by partners including Facebook and Google. Van Jones is a leading spokesman for this program. I think the greatest part is the alignment with the parents. The parents are on board with their kids learning to be programmers. I believe the family and the parents are the most important thing in a child's development. You can have the kids seemingly doing the greatest things at school all you want, but if their home-life is rotten and unsupportive, you have an unsustainable venture. In this case, with so much support for these kids so far, I think this initiative is promising in turning the tide to a more balanced demographic of coders in the next generation.</p>
