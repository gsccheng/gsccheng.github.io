<h2>Hungry for Arrays and Hashes</h2>
<p>Maybe it is because I'm really hungry right now as I type this, and hashes sound like hash browns, but to be a Ruby-ist, you would probably need a good balance of arrays and hashes in your diet. At the core of probably any programming language, you will get the opportunity to define your variables and define your methods. Sure, you will have different types of data, whether a string, integer, or root beer floats, but do you really think a language with just that complexity is really enough? What is the point of programming anything anyways? </p>

<p>The point of programming is to be able to represent information so that it can be of use to people. Do you honestly think to display the things we see on the World Wide Web that elementary data types like strings, integers can be enough? Arrays and hashes make the organization of information SO much easier.</p>

<p>You can think of arrays and hashes like that next level of data structure, similar to a list or table of information. They are built-into Ruby and you can make a new one by typing in to your shell: "Array.new" or "Hash.new" and setting that equal to a variable name. An alternative is to type arrays with these brackets [ ] and hashes with these curly braces { }. For example, an array and a hash would be ex1=[1,2,3] and ex2={a:1,b:2,c:3} respectively. You are probably wondering what those 3 pairs are in the hash. These are called key-value pairs, where the syntax is key:value. To retrieve the first values, in these examples, we can do this for arrays <br><br>
ex1[0] <br>
=> 2 <br>
and this for hashes: <br>
ex2[:a] <br>
=> 1 <br><br>
Note that for arrays, the index number you call starts from 0. They keys and values can be any data structure for arrays and hashes. </p>

<p>So, can you think of why you may want to use an array or hash over the other? Arrays are useful when you just need a list of items, throwing it all into the same bucket. Perhaps you want to put together a shopping list you need to buy at the groceries today, so you can create an array called shopping_list and throw each item in there. However, hashes are useful if you need to associate your items with something else (the key). Perhaps you want to keep a database of information like you wanted to label what each person's favorite color is. In this case, your key will be the person's name while the value will be their favorite color. Another example, if secured, would be something like usernames and passwords.</p>

<p>So that's the basics of arrays and hashes. Hope you had your fill, and enjoy using them!</p>
