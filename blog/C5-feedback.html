<h2>Thoughts on Pairing for Coding Challenges</h2>
<h1>My Experience Pairing with Others</h1>
<p>I have had a great time pairing with others and don't have any major negative experiences. I like how everyone I worked with have been kind and very capable to work with. I realize however that the experience is a lot better in person that on video chat. It puts a lot more of a human element to work with others and get their perspective on the same problems. I still feel a bit uncomfortable with the navigator and driver roles, in terms not overstepping or not doing enough. So far, I haven't had any negative critique on it so I won't make any major changes However, I still need to catch myself trying to stick to my role.</p>
<p>Although I haven't had any real issues pairing, for these types of challenges we've been doing, I think I am more comfortable with and have a more meaningful experience working by myself. This is because when I'm working with others, I feel more pressure to hurry and may not think about and absorb the problem as much as I would like to. However, working with others keep you more disciplined to finish the problem at a set time without being distracted by other things. </p>
<h1>My Feedback</h1>
<p>I felt some nervous anticipation reading my feedback: "What do people think think of me?" Although some of them contradicted with feedback from others, I did get some useful and actionable feedback. The two that stuck out is to be more assertive while navigating and the other is to make sure my partner is following along with what I'm saying. I also think instead of speaking out loud of what to do, I will speak more out loud of the general strategy.</p>
<p>By far the biggest challenge and burdensome thing to do while writing feedback is thinking of some constructive feedback for the person. I feel like I am forced to say something bad about them and I can easily overstate something minor as something major. So, I had to carefully pick the wording. Also, I found it difficult being specific in the feedback without identifying who I am.</p><br><br><br><br><br>
